Method of feature selection 
===========================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz.  Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (body accelaration time-XYZ and gravity accelaration time-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (body accelaration jerk time-XYZ and body gyroscope time-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (body accelaration magnitude time, gravity accelaration magnitude time, body accelaration magnitude jerk time, body gyroscope magnitude time, body gyroscope jerk magnitude time). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing body accelaration frequence-XYZ, body accelaration jerk frequence-XYZ, body gyroscope frequence-XYZ, body accelaration jerk magnitude frequence, body gyroscope magnitude frequence, body gyroscope jerk magnitude frequence. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
